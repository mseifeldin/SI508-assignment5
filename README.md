# Testing `SI508_cards.py`

##This repository contains a python file (SI508_cards.py) that:
 * encodes the play of a game of War with a virtual deck of cards
 * constructs a Card that constructs individual cards with specified suit and rank
 * constructs a Deck class that constructs & allows manipulation of a virtual deck of cards

##It also contains a file (SI508_assignment5_tests.py) that tests the intended functionality of the original file. Other files in this repository support the creation of the two primary files
